### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Sanjo**](https://my-portfolio-unst.vercel.app/), a Full Stack Developer based in India.

I’m passionate about backend development, cloud computing, and building scalable, real-world systems that solve meaningful problems.

I specialize in server-side development using **Java** and **Spring Boot**, and I enjoy writing clean, efficient logic that powers reliable APIs and services. I also explore modern cloud technologies like **AWS** to deploy, manage, and scale backend systems.

Recently, I've been diving deep into **distributed systems** and **event-driven architecture** using **Apache Kafka**. I'm particularly interested in how microservices can communicate reliably and efficiently through asynchronous messaging.

#### Projects:

* You’ll find some of my backend-focused projects pinned on my profile — built with love, logs, and a strong dose of real-world architecture.
